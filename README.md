# Minitest::Redgreen

This is a proof of concept for colorizing minitest output. This was only
written as an exercise. For a more reliable and full-featured solution, I
highly recommend you take a look at the wonderful
[minitest-reporters](https://github.com/kern/minitest-reporters) gem.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'minitest-redgreen'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install minitest-redgreen

## Usage

Add this line to your application's test\_helper.rb or spec\_helper.rb:

    require 'minitest/redgreen'

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
